# HTTP Status Errors

Throw HTTP error status codes as `Error`s!


## Installation

    $ npm install --save http-status-errors

## Usage

Import the errors you want to use, or all of them.

```js
import {NotFoundError} from 'http-status-errors';
// or...
import * as errors from 'http-status-errors';
```

Or if you're stuck with old-fashioned JS:

```js
var NotFoundError = require('http-status-errors').NotFoundError;
// or...
var errors = require('http-status-errors')
```

Once you've imported the package, just throw as normal.  All constructors accept a message as the only argument, otherwise they'll use the default message for that error.  All errors also have a `code` field which is the corresponding HTTP status code as an integer.

E.g.:

```js
throw new NotFoundError('widget not found');
```
